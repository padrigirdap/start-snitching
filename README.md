Pollute This Page is a one page app that visualizes pollution events around the world. Users are able to submit links with descriptions of the pollution events and are prompted to use a marker to mark coordinates on the map that will then automatically generate an address. The app utilizes a Rails back end, Javascript front end, Mapbox API for mapping, and Leafletjs and Foundation for styling.

My background is in Environmental Science. I grew up in the Boston area and remember when it was America's dirtiest harbor, so I've always been aware of the issues we face with pollution. It's a cause I care deeply about, and I'm also very interested in getting into data visualization, user experience, and interface design.
